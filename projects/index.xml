Monzo is a UK based online first bank. Ynab is a budgeting application that allows you to track expenses and keep monthly pots. Unfortunately Ynab does not support auto syncing with pretty much all UK banks but offers a great REST api and Monzo supports transaction webhooks.
I implemented a simple lambda function that executed via an API gateway, and registered the function with Monzo, automatically adding my transactions to my budgeting app.</description>

Studying for my data structures course, I implemented a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path across a HTML grid with obstacles in javascript.

During the first year of university I came across a number of logic problems in revision and exams, to give me an easy way to check my work and improve my Python I created a dynamic truth table generator that outputs to the console the result of the python expresson entered into a REPL loop.
enter python expression or type exit. &amp;gt; r and q | q | r | r and q | | True| True| True | | True| False| False | | False| True| False | | False| False| False |  </description>
